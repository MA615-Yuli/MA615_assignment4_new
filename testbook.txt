45755 "The train, with a shrill whistle, pulled into Summering. For a moment"
45755 "the black coaches stood still in the silvery light of the uplands to"
45755 "eject a few vivid human figures and to swallow up others. Exacerbated"
45755 "voices called back and forth; then, with a puffing and a chugging and"
45755 "another shrill shriek, the dark train clattered into the opening of the"
45755 "tunnel, and once more the landscape stretched before the view unbroken"
45755 "in all its wide expanse, the background swept clean by the moist wind."
45755 ""
45755 "One of the arrivals, a young man pleasantly distinguished by his good"
45755 "dress and elastic walk, hurried ahead of the others and entered one of"
45755 "the hotel 'buses. The horses took the steep road leisurely. Spring was"
45755 "in the air. Up in the sky floated the white shifting clouds of May and"
45755 "June, light, sportive young creatures, playfully coursing the blue path"
45755 "of heaven, suddenly dipping and hiding behind the mountains, embracing"
45755 "and running away, crumpling up like handkerchiefs, elongating into gauzy"
45755 "scarfs, and ending their play by roguishly perching white caps on the"
45755 "mountain tops. There was unrest below, too, in the wind, which shook the"
45755 "lean trees, still wet from the rain, and set their limbs a-groaning"
45755 "softly and brought down a thousand shining drops. Sometimes a cool"
45755 "breath of snow descended from the mountains, and then there was a feel"
45755 "in the air both balmy and cutting. All things in the atmosphere and on"
45755 "the earth were in motion and astir with the ferment of impatience. The"
45755 "horses tossed their heads and snorted as they now trotted down a"
45755 "descent, the sound of their bells jingling far ahead of them."
45755 ""
45755 "On arriving at the hotel, the young man made straight for the registry"
45755 "and looked over the list of guests. He was disappointed."
45755 ""
45755 "\"What the deuce have I come here for?\" he thought in vexation. \"Stuck"
45755 "'way up here on top of the mountain all alone, no company; why it's"
45755 "worse than the office. I must have come either too early or too late. I"
45755 "never do have luck with my holidays. Not a single name do I know. If"
45755 "only there was a woman or two here to pick up a flirtation with, even a"
45755 "perfectly innocent one, if it must be, just to keep the week from being"
45755 "too utterly dismal.\""
45755 ""
45755 "The young man, a baron not very high up in the country's nobility, held"
45755 "a government position, and had secured this short vacation not because"
45755 "he required it particularly, but because his colleagues had all got a"
45755 "week off in spring and he saw no reason for making a present of his"
45755 "\"week off\" to the government. Although not without inner resources, he"
45755 "was a thoroughly social being, his sociability being the very quality"
45755 "for which his friends liked him and for which he was welcomed in all"
45755 "circles. He was quite conscious of his inability to stay by himself and"
45755 "had no inclination to meet himself, as it were, but rather avoided his"
45755 "own company, feeling not the least urge to become intimately acquainted"
45755 "with his own soul. He knew he required contact with other human beings"
45755 "to kindle his talents and stir up the warmth and exuberance of his"
45755 "spirits. Alone he was like a match in a box, frosty and useless."
45755 ""
45755 "He paced up and down the hall, completely out of sorts, stopping now and"
45755 "then irresolutely to turn the leaves of the magazines, or to glance at"
45755 "the newspapers, or to strike up a waltz on the piano in the music-room."
45755 "Finally he sat down in a sulk and watched the growing dusk and the gray"
45755 "mist steal in patches between the fir-trees. After a long, vain,"
45755 "fretful hour he took refuge in the dining-room."
45755 ""
45755 "As yet only a few of the tables were occupied. He took them in at a"
45755 "swift glance. No use. No one he knew, except--he responded to the"
45755 "greeting listlessly--a gentleman to whom he had spoken on the train, and"
45755 "farther off a familiar face from the metropolis. No one else. Not a"
45755 "single woman to promise even a momentary adventure. He became more and"
45755 "more impatient and out of sorts."
45755 ""
45755 "Being a young man favored with a handsome face, he was always prepared"
45755 "for a new experience. He was of the sort of men who are constantly on"
45755 "the lookout for an opportunity to plunge into an adventure for the sake"
45755 "of its novelty, yet whom nothing surprises because, forever lying in"
45755 "wait, they have calculated every possibility in advance. Such men never"
45755 "overlook any element of the erotic. The very first glance they cast at a"
45755 "woman is a probe into the sensual, a searching, impartial probe that"
45755 "knows no distinction between the wife of a friend or the maid who opens"
45755 "the door to her house. One rarely realizes, in using the ready-made word"
45755 "\"woman-hunter,\" which we toss in contempt at such men, how true the"
45755 "expression is and how much of faithful observation it implies. In their"
45755 "watchful alertness all the passionate instincts of the chase are afire,"
45755 "the stalking, the excitement, the cruel cunning. They are always at"
45755 "their post, always ready and determined to follow the tracks of an"
45755 "adventure up to the very brink of the precipice, always loaded with"
45755 "passion, not with the passion of a lover, but with the cold,"
45755 "calculating, dangerous passion of a gambler. Some of them are doggedly"
45755 "persevering, their whole life shaping itself, from this expectancy, into"
45755 "one perpetual adventure. Each day is divided for them into a hundred"
45755 "little sensual experiences--a passing look, a flitting smile, an"
45755 "accidental contact of the knees--and each year into a hundred such days,"
45755 "in which the sensual experience constitutes the ever-flowing,"
45755 "life-giving and quickening source of their existence."
45755 ""
45755 "There was no partner for a game here--that the baron's experienced eye"
45755 "instantly detected. And there is nothing more exasperating than for a"
45755 "player with cards in his hands, conscious of his ability, to be sitting"
45755 "at the green table vainly awaiting a partner. The baron called for a"
45755 "newspaper, but merely ran his eyes down the columns fretfully. His"
45755 "thoughts were crippled and he stumbled over the words."
45755 ""
45755 "Suddenly he heard the rustling of a dress and a woman's voice saying in"
45755 "a slightly vexed tone:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"_Mais tais toi donc, Edgar._\" Her accent was affected."
45755 ""
45755 "A tall voluptuous figure in silk crackled by his table, followed by a"
45755 "small, pale boy in a black velvet suit. The boy eyed the baron"
45755 "curiously, as the two seated themselves at a table reserved for them"
45755 "opposite to him. The child was making evident efforts to be correct in"
45755 "his behavior, but propriety seemed to be out of keeping with the dark,"
45755 "restless expression of his eyes."
45755 ""
45755 "The lady--the young man's attention was fixed upon her only--was very"
45755 "much betoiletted and dressed with conspicuous elegance. She was a type"
45755 "that particularly appealed to the baron, a Jewess with a somewhat"
45755 "opulent figure, close to, though not yet arrived at, the borderline of"
45755 "overmaturity, and evidently of a passionate nature like his, yet"
45755 "sufficiently experienced to hide her temperament behind a veil of"
45755 "dignified melancholy. He could not see her eyes, but was able to admire"
45755 "the lovely curve of her eyebrows arching clean and well-defined above a"
45755 "nose delicate yet nobly curved and giving her face distinction. It was"
45755 "her nose that betrayed her race. Her hair, in keeping with everything"
45755 "else about her, was remarkably luxuriant. Her beauty seemed to have"
45755 "grown sated and boastful with the sure sense of the wealth of admiration"
45755 "it had evoked."
45755 ""
45755 "She gave her order in a very low voice and told the boy to stop making a"
45755 "noise with his fork, this with apparent indifference to the baron's"
45755 "cautious, stealthy gaze. She seemed not to observe his look, though, as"
45755 "a matter of fact, it was his keen, alert vigilance that had made her"
45755 "constrained."
45755 ""
45755 "A flash lit up the gloom of the baron's face. His nerves responded as to"
45755 "an underground current, his muscles tautened, his figure straightened"
45755 "up, fire came to his eyes. He was not unlike the women who require a"
45755 "masculine presence to bring out their full powers. He needed the"
45755 "stimulation of sex completely to energize his faculties. The hunter in"
45755 "him scented the prey. His eyes tried to challenge hers, and her glance"
45755 "crossed his, but waveringly without ever giving an occasional relaxation"
45755 "of the muscles round her mouth, as if in an incipient smile, but he was"
45755 "not sure, and the very uncertainty of it aroused him. The one thing that"
45755 "held out promise was her constant looking away from him, which argued"
45755 "both resistance and embarrassment. Then, too, the conversation that she"
45755 "kept up with her child encouraged him, being obviously designed for"
45755 "show, while her outward calm, he felt, was forced and quite superficial,"
45755 "actually indicating the commencement of inner agitation. He was"
45755 "a-quiver. The play had begun."
45755 ""
45755 "He made his dinner last a long while, and for a full half-hour, almost"
45755 "steadily, he kept the woman fixed with his gaze, until it had travelled"
45755 "over every line of her face and touched, unseen, every spot of her"
45755 "body."
45755 ""
45755 "Outside the darkness fell heavily, the woods groaned as if in childish"
45755 "fear of the large, rain-laden clouds stretching out gray hands after"
45755 "them. The shadows deepened in the room, and the silence seemed to press"
45755 "the people closer together. Under the dead weight of the stillness, the"
45755 "baron clearly noted that the mother's conversation with her son became"
45755 "still more constrained and artificial and would soon, he was sure, cease"
45755 "altogether."
45755 ""
45755 "He resolved upon an experiment. He rose and went to the door slowly,"
45755 "looking past the woman at the prospect outside. At the door he gave a"
45755 "quick turn, as if he had forgotten something, and caught her looking at"
45755 "him with keen interest. That titillated him."
45755 ""
45755 "He waited in the hall. Presently she appeared, holding the boy's hand"
45755 "and paused for a while to look through some magazines and show the child"
45755 "a few pictures. The baron walked up to the table with a casual air,"
45755 "pretending to hunt for a periodical. His real intention was to probe"
45755 "deeper below the moist sheen of her eyes and perhaps even begin a"
45755 "conversation."
45755 ""
45755 "The woman instantly turned away and tapped the boy's shoulder."
45755 ""
45755 "\"_Viens, Edgar. Au lit._\""
45755 ""
45755 "She rustled past the baron. He followed her with his eyes, somewhat"
45755 "disappointed. He had counted upon making the acquaintance that very"
45755 "evening. Her brusque manner was disconcerting. However, there was a"
45755 "fascination in her resistance, and the very uncertainty added zest to"
45755 "the chase. At all events he had found a partner, and the play could"
45755 "begin."

45755 ""
45755 ""
45755 "The next morning, on entering the hall, the baron saw the son of the"
45755 "beautiful Unknown engaged in an eager conversation with the two elevator"
45755 "boys, to whom he was showing pictures in a book by Du Chaillu. His"
45755 "mother was not with him, probably not having come down from her room"
45755 "yet."
45755 ""
45755 "The baron took his first good look at the boy. He seemed to be a shy,"
45755 "undeveloped, nervous little fellow, about twelve years old. His"
45755 "movements were jerky, his eyes dark and restless, and he made the"
45755 "impression, so often produced by children of his age, of being scared,"
45755 "as if he had just been roused out of sleep and placed in strange"
45755 "surroundings. His face was not unbeautiful, but still quite undecided."
45755 "The struggle between childhood and young manhood seemed just about to be"
45755 "setting in. Everything in him so far was like dough that has been"
45755 "kneaded but not formed into a loaf. Nothing was expressed in clean"
45755 "lines, everything was blurred and unsettled. He was at that hobbledehoy"
45755 "age when clothes do not fit, and sleeves and trousers hang slouchily,"
45755 "and there is no vanity to prompt care of one's appearance."
45755 ""
45755 "The child made a rather pitiful impression as he wandered about the"
45755 "hotel aimlessly. He got in everybody's way. He would plague the porter"
45755 "with questions and then be shoved aside, for he would stand in the"
45755 "doorway and obstruct the passage. Apparently there were no other"
45755 "children for him to play with, and in his child's need for prattle he"
45755 "would try to attach himself to one or other of the hotel attendants."
45755 "When they had time they would answer him, but the instant an adult came"
45755 "along they would stop talking and refuse to pay any more attention to"
45755 "him."
45755 ""
45755 "It interested the baron to watch the child, and he looked on smiling as"
45755 "the unhappy little creature inspected everything and everybody"
45755 "curiously, while he himself was universally avoided as a nuisance. Once"
45755 "the baron intercepted one of his curious looks. His black eyes instantly"
45755 "fell, when he saw himself observed, and hid behind lowered lids. The"
45755 "baron was amused. The boy actually began to interest him, and it flashed"
45755 "into his mind that he might be made to serve as the speediest means for"
45755 "bringing him and his mother together. He could overcome his shyness,"
45755 "since it proceeded from nothing but fear. At any rate, it was worth the"
45755 "trial. So when Edgar strolled out of the door to pet, in his child's"
45755 "need of tenderness, the pinkish nostrils of one of the 'bus horses, the"
45755 "baron followed him."
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar was certainly unlucky. The driver chased him away rather roughly."
45755 "Insulted and bored, he stood about aimlessly again, with a vacant,"
45755 "rather melancholy expression in his eyes. The baron now addressed him."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Well, young man, how do you like it here?\" He attempted a tone of"
45755 "jovial ease."
45755 ""
45755 "The child turned fairly purple and looked up in actual alarm, drawing"
45755 "his arms close to his body and twisting and turning in embarrassment."
45755 "For the first time in his life a stranger was the one to address him and"
45755 "not he the stranger."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Oh,\" he managed to stammer out, choking over the last words, \"thank"
45755 "you. I--I like it.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"You do? I'm surprised,\" the baron laughed. \"It's a dull place,"
45755 "especially for a young man like you. What do you do with yourself all"
45755 "day long?\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar was still too confused to give a ready answer. Could it be true"
45755 "that this stranger, this elegant gentleman, was trying to pick up a"
45755 "conversation with him--with him, whom nobody had ever before cared a rap"
45755 "about? It made him both shy and proud. He pulled himself together with"
45755 "difficulty."
45755 ""
45755 "\"I read, and we do a lot of walking. Sometimes we go out driving, mother"
45755 "and I. I am here to get well. I was sick. I must be out in the sunshine"
45755 "a lot, the doctor said.\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar spoke the last with greater assurance. Children are always proud"
45755 "of their ailments. The danger they are in makes them more important,"
45755 "they know, in the eyes of their elders."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Yes, the sun is good for you. It will tan your cheeks. But you oughtn't"
45755 "to be standing round the whole day long. A fellow like you ought to be"
45755 "on the go, running, jumping, playing, full of spirits, and up to"
45755 "mischief, too. It strikes me you are too good. With that big fat book"
45755 "under your arm you look as though you were always poking in the house."
45755 "By jingo, when I think of the kind of fellow I was at your age, I used"
45755 "to raise the devil, and every evening I came home with torn"
45755 "knickerbockers. Don't be so good, whatever you are.\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar could not help smiling, and the consciousness of his own smile"
45755 "removed his fear. Now he was anxious to say something in reply, but it"
45755 "seemed self-assertive and impudent to answer this affable stranger, who"
45755 "spoke to him in such a friendly way. He never had been forward and was"
45755 "easily abashed, so that now he was in the greatest embarrassment from"
45755 "sheer happiness and shame. He would have liked to continue the"
45755 "conversation, but nothing occurred to him. Luckily the great yellow St."
45755 "Bernard belonging to the hotel came up and sniffed at both of them and"
45755 "allowed himself to be petted."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Do you like dogs?\" asked the baron."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Oh, very much. Grandma has one in her villa at Bains. When we stop"
45755 "there he stays with me the whole time. But that's only in the summer"
45755 "when we go visiting.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"We have a lot of dogs at home on our estate, a full two dozen, I"
45755 "believe. If you behave yourself here I'll make you a present of one,"
45755 "brown with white ears, a pup still. Would you like to have it?\""
45755 ""
45755 "The child turned scarlet with joy."
45755 ""
45755 "\"I should say so.\""
45755 ""
45755 "The words fairly burst from his lips in an access of eagerness. Then he"
45755 "caught himself up and stammered in distress and as if frightened:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"But mother won't allow me to have a dog. She says she won't keep a dog"
45755 "in the house. It's too much of a nuisance.\""
45755 ""
45755 "The baron smiled. The conversation had at last come round to the mother."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Is your mother so strict?\""
45755 ""
45755 "The child pondered and looked up for an instant as if to find out"
45755 "whether the stranger was to be trusted on such slight acquaintance."
45755 ""
45755 "\"No,\" he finally answered cautiously, \"she's not strict, and since I've"
45755 "been sick she lets me do anything I want. Maybe she'll even let me keep"
45755 "a dog.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Shall I ask her?\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Oh, yes, please do,\" Edgar cried delightedly. \"If _you_ do I'm sure"
45755 "she'll give in. What does he look like? White ears, you said? Can he do"
45755 "any tricks yet?\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Yes, all sorts of tricks.\" The baron had to smile at the sparkle of"
45755 "Edgar's eyes. It had been so easy to kindle that light in them."
45755 ""
45755 "All at once the child's constraint dropped away, and all his"
45755 "emotionalism, kept in check till then by fear, bubbled over. In a flash"
45755 "the shy, intimidated child of a minute before turned into a boisterous"
45755 "lad."
45755 ""
45755 "\"If only his mother is transformed so quickly,\" the baron thought. \"If"
45755 "only she shows so much ardor behind her reserve.\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar went at him with a thousand questions."
45755 ""
45755 "\"What's the dog's name?\""

45755 "quick success, resolved to strike while the iron was hot, and invited"

45755 "evasive way in which Edgar answered his question as to whether his"

45755 "none of the happiest. He was almost ashamed at having been able to"
45755 "extract these family secrets from the unsuspecting child, for Edgar,"
45755 "very proud that anything he had to say could interest a grown-up person,"
45755 "fairly pressed confidences upon his new friend. His child's heart beat"
45755 "with pride--the baron had put his arm on his shoulder while they were"
45755 "walking--to be seen in such close intimacy with a \"man,\" and gradually"
45755 "he forgot he was a child and talked quite unconstrainedly, as if to an"
45755 "equal."

45755 "From his conversation it was quite clear that he was a bright boy, in"
45755 "fact, a bit too precocious, as are most sickly children who spend much"
45755 "time with their elders, and his likes and dislikes were too marked. He"
45755 "took nothing calmly or indifferently. Every person or thing was"
45755 "discussed with either passionate enthusiasm or a hatred so intense as to"
45755 "distort his face into a mean, ugly look. There was something wild and"
45755 "jerky about his manner, accentuated perhaps by the illness he was just"
45755 "recovering from, which gave his talk the fieriness of fanaticism. His"
45755 "awkwardness seemed to proceed from the painfully suppressed fear of his"
45755 "own passion."

45755 "Before the end of half an hour the baron was already holding the boy's"
45755 "throbbing heart in his hands. It is so infinitely easy to deceive"
45755 "children, those unsuspecting creatures whose love is so rarely courted."
45755 "All the baron needed to do was to transport himself back to his own"
45755 "childhood, and the talk flowed quite naturally. Edgar felt himself in"
45755 "the presence of an equal, and within a few minutes had lost all sense of"
45755 "distance between them, and was perfectly at ease, conscious of nothing"
45755 "but bliss at having so unexpectedly found a friend in this lonely place."
45755 "And what a friend! Forgotten were all his mates in the city where he"
45755 "lived, those little boys with their thin voices and inexperienced"
45755 "chatter. This one hour had almost expunged their faces. All his"

45755 "On parting the baron invited him to take a walk with him again the next"
45755 "morning. Edgar's heart expanded with pride. And, when from a little"
45755 "distance away the baron waved back to him like a real playmate, it was"
45755 "probably the happiest moment in his life. It is so easy to deceive"
45755 "children."

45755 "The baron smiled as he looked after the boy dashing away. The go-between"
45755 "had been won. Edgar, he knew, would bore his mother with stories of the"
45755 "wonderful baron and would repeat every word he had said. At this he"
45755 "recalled complacently how cleverly he had woven in some compliments for"
45755 "the mother's consumption. \"Your beautiful mother,\" he had always said."
45755 "There was not the faintest shadow of doubt in his mind that the"

45755 "dinner was over, Edgar was told he must go straight to bed, and an eager"
45755 "whispering began between him and his mother, which resulted in a"
45755 "concession to the boy. He was allowed to go to the baron and say"

45755 "so many detailed questions that the mother was compelled to reply, and"

45755 "first time he had played a part in the life of adults. In his half-awake"
45755 "state he forgot that he was a child and all at once felt himself a grown"
45755 "man. Brought up an only child and often ailing, he had never had many"
45755 "friends. His parents, who paid little attention to him, and the servants"

45755 "The power of love is not properly gauged if it is estimated only by the"

45755 ""
45755 "The painful sense of his impotence to show his feelings in some way or"

45755 "stamps and marbles and jacks. Now such childish possessions, which only"
45755 "the day before had still had vast importance and charm in his eyes, had"
45755 "depreciated in value. They seemed silly. He disdained them. He couldn't"

45755 "morning's appointment. At seven o'clock he awoke with a start, fearful"
45755 "that he was too late already. He dressed hastily and astonished his"
45755 "mother when he went in to say good-morning because she had always had"

45755 "acted as though he were quite ready to keep his promise when the boy"
45755 "came rushing at him so eagerly. He took Edgar's arm and paced up and"
45755 "down the lobby with him leisurely. Edgar was radiant, although the"
45755 "baron gently but firmly refused to start on the walk at once. He seemed"
45755 "to be waiting for something. Every once in a while he gave a nervous"
45755 "glance at one of the various doors. Suddenly he drew himself up. Edgar's"
45755 "mother had entered the hall."

45755 "and him alone. To be sure, he had introduced his friend to his mother,"
45755 "but only out of courtesy. He had not meant to share him with anybody."
45755 "Something like jealousy began to stir in him when he observed the"
45755 "baron's friendliness to his mother."
45755 ""
45755 "On the walk the dangerous sense the child had of his importance and"
45755 "sudden rise to prominence was heightened by the interest the two adults"

45755 "conversation. His mother expressed rather hypocritical solicitude on"

45755 "was nothing to worry about and extolled his young \"friend's\" good"
45755 "manners and pleasant ways."

45755 "It was the happiest hour of Edgar's life. Rights were granted him that"

45755 "conversation without a prompt \"keep quiet, Edgar.\" He could even express"
45755 "bold desires for which he would have been rebuked before. No wonder the"
45755 "deceptive feeling that he was grown up began to flourish in his"

45755 "The impatient hunter felt the time had come to creep up on his game. The"
45755 "three-sidedness of the sport annoyed him, and so did the tone of it. To"
45755 "sit there and chat was rather pleasant, but he was after more than mere"
45755 "talk. Social intercourse, with the mask it puts over desire, always, he"
45755 "knew, retards the erotic between man and woman. Words lose their ardor,"
45755 "the attack its fire. Despite their conversation together on indifferent"
45755 "matters, Edgar's mother must never forget his real object, of which, he"
45755 "was quite convinced, she was already aware."
45755 ""
45755 "That his efforts to catch this woman were not to prove in vain seemed"
45755 "very probable. She was at the critical age when a woman begins to regret"
45755 "having remained faithful to a husband she has never truly loved, and"
45755 "when the purple sunset of her beauty still affords her a final urgent"
45755 "choice between motherliness and womanliness. The life whose questions"
45755 "seem to have been answered long before becomes a problem again, and for"
45755 "the last time the magnetic needle of the will wavers between the hope"
45755 "for an intense love experience and ultimate resignation. The woman has a"
45755 "dangerous decision to confront, whether she will live her own life or"
45755 "that of her children, whether she will be a woman first, or a mother"
45755 "first."
45755 ""
45755 "The baron, who was very perspicacious in these matters, thought that he"
45755 "discerned in Edgar's mother this very vacillation between passion to"
45755 "live her own life and readiness to sacrifice her desires. In"
45755 "conversation she always omitted to mention her husband. Evidently he"
45755 "satisfied nothing but her bare external needs and not the snobbishness"
45755 "that an aristocratic way of living had excited in her. And as for her"
45755 "son, she knew precious little of the child's soul. A shadow of boredom,"
45755 "wearing the veil of melancholy in her dark eyes, lay over her life and"
45755 "obscured her sensuousness."
45755 ""
45755 "The baron resolved to act quickly, yet at the same time to avoid any"
45755 "appearance of haste. Like an angler, who tempts the fish by dangling and"
45755 "withdrawing the bait, he would affect a show of indifference and let"
45755 "himself be courted while he was the one that was actually doing the"
45755 "courting. He would put on an air of haughtiness and bring into sharp"
45755 "relief the difference in their social ranks. There was fascination in"
45755 "the idea of getting possession of that lovely, voluptuous creature"
45755 "simply by stressing his pride, by mere externals, by the use of a"
45755 "high-sounding aristocratic name and the adoption of a cold, proud"

45755 "The chase was already growing hot. He had to be cautious and not show"
45755 "his excitement. So he remained in his room the whole afternoon, filled"
45755 "with the pleasant consciousness of being looked for and missed. But his"
45755 "absence was felt not so much by the woman, upon whom the effect was"
45755 "intended, as by Edgar."
45755 ""
45755 "To the wretched child it was simple torture. The whole afternoon he felt"
45755 "absolutely impotent and lost. With the obstinate faithfulness of a boy"
45755 "he waited long, long hours for his friend. To have gone away or done"
45755 "anything by himself would have seemed like a crime against their"
45755 "friendship, and he loafed the time away in the hotel corridors, his"
45755 "heart growing heavier and heavier as each moment passed. After a while"
45755 "his heated imagination began to dwell on a possible accident or an"

45755 "The hunter in him awakened. He was intoxicated, thoroughly excited at"

45755 "close to the muzzle of his gun. His eyes sparkled, his blood shot"
45755 "through his veins. The words fairly bubbled from his lips with no"
45755 "conscious effort on his part. Like all men with pronouncedly erotic"
45755 "temperaments, he did twice as well, was twice himself when he knew a"
45755 "woman liked him, as some actors take fire when they feel that their"
45755 "auditors, the breathing mass of humanity in front of them, are"
45755 "completely under their spell."
45755 ""
45755 "Naturally an excellent raconteur, with great skill in graphic"
45755 "description, he now surpassed himself. Besides, he drank several glasses"
45755 "of champagne, ordered in honor of the new friendship. He told of hunting"
45755 "big game in India, where he had gone at the invitation of an English"
45755 "nobleman. The theme was well chosen. The conversation had necessarily to"
45755 "be about indifferent matters, but this subject, the baron felt, would"

45755 "The one, however, upon whom the greater charm was exercised was Edgar."
45755 "His eyes glowed with enthusiasm. He forgot to eat or drink and stared at"

45755 "He had never expected actually to see a man who in his own person had"
45755 "experienced those tremendous things which he read about in his"
45755 "books--tiger hunts, brown men, Hindus, and the terrible Juggernaut,"
45755 "which crushed thousands of men under its wheels. Until then he had"
45755 "thought such men did not really exist and believed in them no more than"
45755 "in fairyland. A certain new and great feeling expanded his chest. He"
45755 "could not remove his eyes from his friend and stared with bated breath"
45755 "at the hands across the table that had actually killed a tiger. Scarcely"
45755 "did he dare to ask a question, and when he ventured to speak it was with"
45755 "a feverish tremor in his voice. His lively imagination drew the picture"
45755 "for each story. He saw his friend mounted high on an elephant"
45755 "caparisoned in purple, brown men to the right and to the left wearing"
45755 "rich turbans, and then suddenly the tiger leaping out of the jungle with"
45755 "gnashing teeth and burying its claws in the elephant's trunk."
45755 ""
45755 "Now the baron was telling about something even more interesting, how"

45755 "Edgar's mother stayed at table with the baron a while longer. But the"
45755 "two no longer spoke of elephants or hunting. An indefinable"
45755 "embarrassment instantly sprang up between them, and a faint sultriness"
45755 "descended upon their conversation. After a time they went out into the"
45755 "hall and seated themselves in a corner."
45755 ""
45755 "The baron was more brilliant than ever. The woman was a little heated by"
45755 "her two glasses of champagne, so that the conversation quickly took a"
45755 "dangerous turn. The baron was not what is called exactly handsome. He"
45755 "was simply young and had a manly look in his dark-brown, energetic,"
45755 "boyish face, and he charmed her with his fresh, almost ill-bred"
45755 "movements. She liked looking at him at such close range and was no"
45755 "longer afraid to encounter his eyes."
45755 ""
45755 "Gradually there crept into his language a boldness which vaguely"
45755 "disconcerted her. It was like a gripping of her body and then a letting"
45755 "go, an intangible sort of desire which sent the blood rushing to her"
45755 "face. The next moment, however, he would laugh again, an easy,"
45755 "unconstrained, boyish laugh, which made his little manifestations of"
45755 "desire seem like joking. Sometimes he said things she felt she ought to"
45755 "object to bluntly, but she was a natural-born coquette, and his trifling"
45755 "audacities only provoked in her the taste for more. She was carried away"
45755 "by his bold gaze, and at length got so far as to try to imitate him,"
45755 "answering his looks with little fluttering promises from her own eyes,"
45755 "and giving herself up to him in words and gestures. She permitted him to"
45755 "draw close to her, so that every now and then she felt the warm graze of"
45755 "his breath on her shoulders."
45755 ""
45755 "Like all gamblers, the two forgot the passage of time and became so"
45755 "absorbed that they started in surprise when the lights in the hall were"
45755 "turned off at midnight."
45755 ""
45755 "The woman jumped up in response to the first impulse of alarm she had"
45755 "felt. In the same moment she realized to what audacious lengths she had"
45755 "ventured. It was not the first time she had played with fire, but now"
45755 "her instincts, all aroused, told her the game had come perilously close"
45755 "to being in earnest. She shuddered inwardly at discovering that she no"
45755 "longer felt quite secure, that something in her was slipping and gliding"
45755 "down into an abyss. Her head whirled with alarm, with slight"
45755 "intoxication from the champagne, and with the ring of the baron's"
45755 "ardent language in her ears. A dull dread came over her. She had"
45755 "experienced the same sort of dread several times before in similar"
45755 "dangerous moments, but it had never so overpowered her. This extreme"
45755 "dizziness was something she had never before experienced."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Good-night,\" she said hastily. \"See you in the morning again.\""
45755 ""

45755 "the moment and from an odd, novel insecurity she felt within herself."
45755 ""
45755 "But the baron held her hand in a tight but gentle grip and kissed it"
45755 "four or five times from the delicate tips of her fingers to her wrist. A"
45755 "little shiver went through her at the graze of his rough mustache on the"
45755 "back of her hand, and her blood ran warm and mounted to her head. Her"
45755 "cheeks glowed. There was a hammering at her temples. A wild unreasoning"
45755 "fear made her snatch her hand away."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Don't go, don't go,\" the baron pleaded in a whisper. But she was"
45755 "already gone, the awkwardness of her haste revealing plainly her fright"
45755 "and confusion. She was undergoing the excitement that the baron wanted."
45755 "She was all confused, one moment in awful dread that the man behind"
45755 "might follow and put his arms round her, and the next instant regretting"
45755 "that he had not done so. In those few seconds the thing might have taken"
45755 "place that she had been dreaming of for years, the great adventure. She"
45755 "had always taken voluptuous delight in creeping up to the very edge of"
45755 "an adventure and then jumping back at the last moment, an adventure of"
45755 "the great and dangerous kind, not a mere fleeting flirtation. But the"
45755 "baron was too proud to push his advantage now, too assured of his"
45755 "victory to take this woman like a robber in a moment of weakness and"
45755 "intoxication. A fair sportsman prefers his game to show fight and to"
45755 "surrender quite consciously. The woman could not escape him. The virus,"
45755 "he knew, was already seething in her veins."
45755 ""
45755 "She stopped on the landing above and pressed her hand to her throbbing"
45755 "heart. She had to rest a while. Her nerves were snapping. She heaved a"
45755 "great sigh, partly of relief at having escaped a danger, partly of"
45755 "regret. Her emotions were mixed, and all she was vividly conscious of"
45755 "was the whirl of her blood and a faint giddiness. With half-closed eyes"
45755 "she groped her way like a drunken woman to the door and breathed with"
45755 "relief when she felt the cool door-knob in her hand. At last she was"
45755 "safe."

45755 "She opened the door softly and the next second started back in fright."

45755 "\"Goodness gracious! What are you doing here?\""

45755 "promise. She was to tell him all about the elephant hunts and the"
45755 "baron's other adventures that very night. And so the simple child had"
45755 "crept into her room and in unquestioning faith had waited for her until"
45755 "he had dropped asleep. The absurdity of it enraged her, or rather she"
45755 "was angry with herself, and for that reason she wanted to outshriek the"
45755 "tiny whisper of her conscience telling her she had done a shameful"
45755 "wrong."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Go to bed at once, you nuisance!\" she cried."

45755 "blur that his mother had not kept her promise and that somehow or other"
45755 "he was being treated meanly. Yet he did not rebel. His susceptibilities"
45755 "were dulled by sleepiness. Besides, he was angry with himself for having"

45755 "The baron had passed a bad night. It is rather vain to attempt to sleep"
45755 "after an adventure that has been abruptly broken off. Tossing on his bed"
45755 "and starting up out of oppressive dreams, the baron was soon regretting"
45755 "that he had not seized the moment. The next morning when he came down he"
45755 "was still sleepy and cross and in no mood to take up with Edgar, who at"
45755 "sight of him rushed out of a corner and threw his arms about his waist"
45755 "and began to pester him with a thousand questions. The boy was happy to"
45755 "have his big friend to himself once more without having to share him"
45755 "with his mother. He implored him not to tell his stories to her, but"
45755 "only to himself. In spite of her promise she had not recounted all"
45755 "those wonderful things she had said she would. Edgar assailed the baron"
45755 "with a hundred childish importunities and stormy demonstrations of love."
45755 "He was so happy at last to have found him again and to be alone with"
45755 "him. He had been waiting for him since early in the morning."
45755 ""
45755 "The baron gave the child rough answers. That eternal lying in wait,"
45755 "those silly questions--in short, the boy's unsolicited passion--began to"
45755 "annoy him. He was tired of going about all day long with a puppy of"
45755 "twelve, talking nonsense. All he cared for now was to strike while the"
45755 "iron was hot and get the mother by herself, the very thing it was"
45755 "difficult to do with this child forever inflicting his presence. For the"
45755 "first time the baron cursed his incautiousness in having inspired so"
45755 "much affection, for he saw no chance, on this occasion at least, to rid"
45755 "himself of his too, too devoted friend."
45755 ""
45755 "At any rate it was worth the trial. The baron waited until ten o'clock,"
45755 "the time Edgar's mother had agreed to go out walking with him. He sat"
45755 "beside the boy, paying no attention to his chatter and even glancing"
45755 "through the paper, though every now and then tossing the child a crumb"
45755 "of talk so as not to insult him. When the hour hand was at ten and the"
45755 "minute hand was just reaching twelve, he asked Edgar, as though suddenly"
45755 "remembering something, to do him a favor and run across to the next"
45755 "hotel and find out if his cousin, Count Rosny, had arrived. Delighted at"
45755 "last to be of service to his friend, the unsuspecting child ran off as"
45755 "fast as his legs would carry him, careering down the road so madly that"
45755 "people looked after him in wonder."
45755 ""
45755 "Count Rosny, the clerk told him, had not arrived, nor had he even"
45755 "announced his coming. Edgar again made post haste back to bring this"
45755 "information to his friend. But where was his friend? Nowhere in the"
45755 "hall. Up in his room perhaps. Edgar dashed up the stairs and knocked at"
45755 "his door. No answer. He ran down again and searched in the music-room,"
45755 "the cafe, the verandas, the smoking room. In vain. He hurried to his"
45755 "mother's room to see if she knew anything about the baron. But she was"
45755 "gone, too. When finally, in his despair, he applied to the porter, he"
45755 "was told the two had gone out together a few minutes before."
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar waited for their return patiently. He was altogether unsuspecting"
45755 "and felt quite sure that they would come back soon because the baron"
45755 "wanted to hear whether or not his cousin had arrived. However, long"
45755 "stretches of time went by, and gradually uneasiness crept upon him. Ever"
45755 "since the moment when that strange, seductive man had entered his little"
45755 "life, never as yet tinged by suspicion, the child had spent his days in"
45755 "one continual state of tension and tremulousness and confusion. Upon"
45755 "such delicate organisms as those of children every emotion impresses"
45755 "itself as upon soft wax. Edgar's eyelids began to twitch again, and he"
45755 "was already a shade or two paler."
45755 ""
45755 "He waited and waited, patiently, at first, then in wild excitement, on"
45755 "the verge of tears. Yet no suspicion crept into his child's soul. So"
45755 "blindly trustful was he of his wonderful friend that he fancied there"
45755 "must have been some misunderstanding, and he tortured himself fearing he"
45755 "had not executed his commission properly."
45755 ""
45755 "But, when they came home at last, how odd that they lingered at the"
45755 "threshold talking gaily without showing the faintest surprise and"
45755 "without, apparently, having missed him very much."
45755 ""
45755 "\"We went out expecting to meet you, Eddie,\" said the baron, forgetting"
45755 "to ask if the count had arrived. When Edgar, in consternation that they"
45755 "must have been looking for him on the way between the two hotels,"
45755 "eagerly asseverated that he had taken the straight road and questioned"
45755 "them about the direction they had gone, his mother cut him off short"
45755 "with, \"All right, Edgar, all right. Children must be seen and not"
45755 "heard.\""
45755 ""
45755 "There, this was the second time, Edgar thought, flushing with anger,"
45755 "that his mother had so horridly tried to make him look small in front of"
45755 "his friend. Why did she do it? Why did she always want to set him down"
45755 "as a child when, he was convinced, he was no longer a child? Evidently"
45755 "she was jealous of his friend and was planning to get him all to"
45755 "herself. Yes, that was it, and it was she who had purposely led the"
45755 "baron the wrong way. But he wouldn't let her treat him like that again,"
45755 "he'd show her. He was going to be spiteful, he wasn't going to say a"
45755 "word to her at table, and he would speak only to his friend."
45755 ""
45755 "However, it was not so easy to keep quiet as he thought it would be."
45755 "Things went in a most unanticipated way. Neither his mother nor the"
45755 "baron noticed his attitude of spitefulness. Why, they did not even pay"
45755 "the slightest attention to him, who, the day before, had been the medium"
45755 "of their coming together. They talked over his head and laughed and"
45755 "joked as though he had disappeared under the table. His blood mounted to"
45755 "his head and a lump came into his throat. A horrid sense of his"
45755 "impotence overwhelmed him. Was it his doom to sit there quietly and look"
45755 "on while his mother stole away from him his friend, the one man he"
45755 "loved, while he, Edgar, made no movement in self-defence and used no"
45755 "other weapon than silence? He felt as though he must get up and pound"
45755 "the table with his clenched fists, just to make them take notice of him."
45755 "But he restrained himself and merely put down his knife and fork and"
45755 "stopped eating. Even this it was a long time before they observed. It"
45755 "was not until the last course that his mother became conscious that he"
45755 "had not tasted his food and asked him if he were not feeling well."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Disgusting,\" he thought. \"That's all she ever thinks of, whether I'm"
45755 "sick or not. Nothing else about me seems to matter to her.\""
45755 ""
45755 "He told her shortly that he wasn't hungry, which quite satisfied her."
45755 "Nothing, absolutely nothing forced them to pay attention to him. The"
45755 "baron seemed to have forgotten him completely, at least he never"
45755 "addressed a single remark to him. His eyeballs were getting hot with"
45755 "suppressed tears, and finally he had to resort to the childlike device"
45755 "of raising his napkin like a screen to hide the traitorous drops that"
45755 "rolled down his cheeks and salted his lips. When the meal finally came"
45755 "to an end, he drew a sigh of relief."
45755 ""
45755 "During the meal his mother had proposed a drive to an interesting spot"
45755 "in the neighborhood and Edgar had listened with his lips between his"
45755 "teeth. So she was not going to allow him a single moment alone with his"
45755 "friend any more. But now, as they got up from table, came something even"
45755 "worse, and Edgar's anger went over into a fury of hate."

45755 "\"Edgar,\" said his mother, \"you'll be forgetting everything you learned"

45755 "humiliating him in front of his friend, publicly reminding him that he"
45755 "was still a child who had to go to school and whose presence was merely"
45755 "tolerated by his elders. This time, however, her intentions were"
45755 "altogether too obvious, and Edgar was satisfied to turn away without"
45755 "replying."

45755 "To this--something in the child's heart congealed--to this the baron,"

45755 "startled to observe, for the first time, in the manner Edgar compressed"
45755 "his lips, a resemblance to her husband when he was annoyed. At that"
45755 "particular moment, when she was playing \"hide-and-seek\" with an"
45755 "adventure, it was more than ordinarily discomfiting to be reminded of"
45755 "her husband. The boy, only a foot or two away, with his dark, restless"
45755 "eyes and that suggestion behind his pale forehead of lying in wait,"
45755 "seemed to her like a ghost, a guardian of her conscience, doubly"
45755 "intolerable there in the close quarters of the carriage. Suddenly, for"
45755 "one second, Edgar looked up and met his mother's gaze. Instantly they"
45755 "dropped their eyes in the consciousness that they were spying on each"
45755 "other. Till then each had had implicit faith in the other. Now something"
45755 "had come between mother and child and made a difference. For the first"
45755 "time in their lives they set to observing each other, to separating"
45755 "their destinies, with secret hate already mounting in their hearts,"

45755 "When the horses pulled up at the hotel entrance, all three were"

45755 "mother excused herself for going straight up to her room, pleading a"

45755 "sway of his slim back which had so enchanted the child that he had"
45755 "immediately begun to imitate the baron's walk. The baron brushed past"
45755 "him, right past him. Evidently he had forgotten him and left him to"
45755 "stand there beside the driver and the horses as though he did not belong"
45755 "to him."
45755 ""
45755 "Something in Edgar broke in two as the man, whom in spite of everything"
45755 "he still idolized, slighted him like that. A bitter despair filled his"
45755 "heart when the baron left without so much as touching him with his cloak"
45755 "or saying a single word, when he, Edgar, was conscious of having done no"
45755 "wrong. His painfully enforced self-restraint gave way, the too heavy"
45755 "burden of dignity that he had imposed upon himself dropped from his"
45755 "narrow little shoulders, and he became the child again, small and"
45755 "humble, as he had been the day before. At the top of the steps he"
45755 "confronted the baron and said in a strained voice, thick with suppressed"
45755 "tears:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"What have I done to you that you don't notice me any more? Why are you"
45755 "always like this with me now? And mamma, too? Why are you always sending"
45755 "me off? Am I a nuisance to you, or have I done anything to offend you?\""
45755 ""
45755 "The baron was startled. There was something in the child's voice that"

45755 "unsuspecting boy."
45755 ""
45755 "\"You're a goose, Eddie. I'm merely out of sorts to-day. You're a dear"

45755 "face so as not to be obliged to see those great moist, beseeching"
45755 "child's eyes. The comedy he was playing was becoming painful. He was"
45755 "beginning to be ashamed of having trifled so insolently with the child's"
45755 "love. That small voice, quivering with suppressed sobs, cut him to the"
45755 "quick. \"Go upstairs now, Eddie. We'll get along together this evening"
45755 "just as nicely as ever, you'll see.\""

45755 ""
45755 "He waited for the decisive test, at table. Nine o'clock came, and his"
45755 "mother had not yet said a word about his going to bed. Why did she let"
45755 "him stay on just that day of all days, she who was usually so exact? It"
45755 "bothered him. Had the baron told her what he had said! He was consumed"
45755 "with regret, suddenly, that he had run after the baron so trustingly. At"
45755 "ten o'clock his mother rose, and took leave of the baron, who, oddly,"
45755 "showed no surprise at her early departure and made no attempt to detain"
45755 "her as he usually did. The hammer beat harder and harder at Edgar's"

45755 "Now he must apply the test with exceeding care. He, too, behaved as"

45755 "his head straight to the baron and seemed to indicate a mutual"
45755 "understanding, a secret held in common. So the baron had betrayed him!"
45755 "That was why his mother had left so early. He, Edgar, was to be lulled"

45755 "that she was slipping away from him because her fear of that annoying,"
45755 "obnoxious child was cooling the passion he had fanned into a flame with"
45755 "so much difficulty. After repeated unsuccessful attempts at a"

45755 "There was active hostility now in each of the three. The betrayed child"

45755 "ironic look at the baron's sullen face and saw how he was muttering"

45755 "them out at him. He also observed with sarcastic glee how his mother's"
45755 "fury was mounting and that both of them were longing for an opportunity"
45755 "to attack him and send him away, or render him innocuous. But he gave"
45755 "them no opening, the tactics of his hate had been prepared too well in"

45755 "on the lad and was thinking of nothing but the goal of his desires,"
45755 "could still contain his anger, but Edgar's mother was losing her hold"

45755 "Edgar sat among them quietly, a trifle pale, with wavering glances. When"
45755 "his mother and the baron appeared in the doorway, rather embarrassed at"
45755 "encountering him so soon, and began to stammer out their excuses"
45755 "prepared in advance, he confronted them calmly, and said to the baron in"
45755 "a tone of challenge:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"I have something to say to you, sir.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Very well, later, a little later.\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar, pitching his voice louder and enunciating every word clearly and"
45755 "distinctly, said, so that everyone in the hall could hear:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"No, now. You behaved like a villain. You knew my mother was waiting for"
45755 "me, and you----\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Edgar!\" cried his mother, feeling all glances upon her, and swooped"
45755 "down on him. But Edgar, realizing that she wanted to shout him down,"
45755 "screamed at the top of his voice:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"I say again, in front of everybody, you lied, you lied disgracefully."
45755 "It was a dirty trick.\""
45755 ""
45755 "The baron went white, the people stared, some laughed. The mother"
45755 "clutched the boy, who was quivering with excitement, and stammered out"
45755 "hoarsely:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"Go right up to your room, or I'll give you a beating right here in"
45755 "front of everybody.\""
45755 ""
45755 "But Edgar had already calmed down. He regretted he had been so violent"
45755 "and was discontented with himself that he had not coolly challenged the"
45755 "baron as he had intended to do. But his anger had been stronger than his"
45755 "will. He turned and walked to the staircase leisurely, with an air of"
45755 "perfect composure."
45755 ""
45755 "\"You must excuse him,\" the mother still went on, stammering, confused by"
45755 "the rather wicked glances fixed upon her, \"he's a nervous child, you"
45755 "know.\""
45755 ""
45755 "She was afraid of nothing so much as a scandal, and she knew she must"
45755 "assume innocence. Instead, therefore, of taking to instant flight, she"
45755 "went up to the desk and asked for her mail and made several other"
45755 "inquiries before rustling up the stairs as though nothing had happened."
45755 "But behind her, she was quite conscious, she had left a wake of"
45755 "whispered comment and suppressed giggling. On the first landing she"
45755 "hesitated, the rest of the steps she mounted more slowly. She was always"
45755 "unequal to a serious situation and was afraid of the inevitable"
45755 "explanation with Edgar. She was guilty, she could not deny that, and she"
45755 "dreaded the child's curious gaze, which paralyzed her and filled her"
45755 "with uncertainty. In her timidity she decided to try gentleness, because"
45755 "in a battle the excited child, she knew, was the stronger."
45755 ""
45755 "She turned the knob gently. Edgar was sitting there quiet and cool, his"
45755 "eyes, turned upon her at her entrance, not even betraying curiosity. He"
45755 "seemed to be very sure of himself."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Edgar,\" she began, in the motherliest of tones, \"what got into you? I"
45755 "was ashamed of you. How can one be so ill-bred, especially a child to a"
45755 "grown-up person? You must ask the baron's pardon at once.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"I will not.\""
45755 ""
45755 "As he spoke Edgar was looking out of the window, and his words might"
45755 "have been meant for the trees. His sureness was beginning to astonish"
45755 "his mother."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Edgar, what's the matter with you? You're so different from what you"
45755 "were. You used to be a good, sensible child with whom a person could"
45755 "reason. And all at once you act as though the devil had got into you."
45755 "What have you got against the baron? You liked him so much at first. He"
45755 "was so nice to you.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Yes, because he wanted to make your acquaintance.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Nonsense. How can you think anything like that?\""
45755 ""
45755 "The child flared up."
45755 ""
45755 "\"He's a liar. He's false through and through. Whatever he does is"
45755 "calculated and common. He wanted to get to know you, so he made friends"
45755 "with me and promised me a dog. I don't know what he promised you, or why"
45755 "he's so friendly with you, but he wants something of you, too, mamma,"
45755 "positively he does. If he didn't, he wouldn't be so polite and friendly."
45755 "He's a bad man. He lies. Just take a good look at him once, and see how"
45755 "false his eyes are. Oh, I hate him!\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Edgar, how can you talk like that!\" She was confused and did not know"
45755 "what to reply. The feeling stirred in her that the child was right."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Yes, he's a bad man, you can't make me believe he isn't. You must see"
45755 "he is. Why is he afraid of me? Why does he try to keep out of my way?"
45755 "Because he knows I can see through him and his badness.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"How can you talk like that?\" she kept protesting feebly. Her brain"
45755 "seemed to have dried up."
45755 ""
45755 "All of a sudden a great fear came upon her, whether of the baron or the"
45755 "boy, she knew not. Edgar saw that his warning was taking effect, and he"
45755 "was lured on to win her over to his side and have a comrade in his hate"
45755 "and hostility toward the baron. He went over to her gently, put his arms"
45755 "about her, and said in a voice flattering with the excitement quivering"
45755 "in it:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"Mamma, you yourself must have noticed that it isn't anything good that"
45755 "he wants. He's made you quite different. You're the one that's changed,"
45755 "not I. He set you against me just to have you to himself. I'm sure he"
45755 "means to deceive you. I don't know what he promised you, but whatever it"
45755 "is, he doesn't intend to keep his promise. You ought to be careful of"
45755 "him. A man who will lie to one person will lie to another person, too."
45755 "He's a bad, bad man. You mustn't trust him.\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar's voice, soft and almost tearful, seemed to speak out of her own"
45755 "heart. Since the day before an uncomfortable feeling had been rising in"
45755 "her which told her the same, with growing emphasis. But she was ashamed"
45755 "to tell her own child he was right, and she took refuge, as so many do"
45755 "when under the stress of overwhelming feeling, in rude rejoinder. She"
45755 "straightened herself up."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Children don't understand such things. You have no right to mix into"
45755 "such matters. You must behave yourself. That's all.\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar's face congealed again."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Very well. I have warned you.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"Then you won't ask the baron's pardon?\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"No.\""
45755 ""
45755 "They stood confronting each other, and the mother knew her authority was"
45755 "at stake."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Then you will stay up here and eat by yourself, and you won't be"
45755 "allowed to come to table and sit with us until you have asked his"
45755 "pardon. I'll teach you manners. You won't budge from this room until I"
45755 "give you permission to, do you hear?\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar smiled. That cunning smile seemed to be part of his lips now."
45755 "Inwardly he was angry at himself. How foolish to have let his heart run"
45755 "away with him again and to have tried to warn her, the liar."
45755 ""
45755 "His mother rustled out without giving him another glance. That caustic"
45755 "gaze of his frightened her. The child had become an absolute annoyance"
45755 "to her since she realized that he had his eyes open and said the very"
45755 "things she did not want to know or hear. It was uncanny to have an inner"
45755 "voice, her conscience, dissevered from herself, incorporated in her"
45755 "child, going about as her child, warning her and making fun of her."
45755 "Until then the child had stayed alongside of her life, as an ornament,"
45755 "a toy, a thing to love and have confidence in, now and then perhaps a"
45755 "burden, but always something that floated along in the same current as"
45755 "her own life, keeping even pace with it. For the first time this"
45755 "something reared itself up and opposed her will. A feeling akin to hate"
45755 "mingled itself in her thoughts of her child now. And yet, as she was"
45755 "descending the stairs, a little tired, childish voice came from her own"
45755 "breast, saying, \"You ought to be careful of him.\""
45755 ""
45755 "On one of the landings was a mirror. The gleam of it struck her eyes,"
45755 "and she paused to scrutinize herself questioningly. She looked deeper"
45755 "and deeper into her own face until the lips of her image parted in a"
45755 "light smile and formed themselves as if to utter a dangerous word. The"
45755 "voice within her was still speaking, but she threw back her shoulders as"
45755 "though to shake off all those invisible thoughts gave her reflection in"
45755 "the glass a bright glance, caught up her skirt, and descended the rest"
45755 "of the stairs with the determined manner of a player who has tossed his"
45755 "last coin down on the table."

45755 "The waiter, after serving Edgar with dinner in his room, closed and"
45755 "locked the door behind him. The child started up in a rage. His mother's"
45755 "doings! She must have given orders for him to be locked in like a"
45755 "vicious beast."
45755 ""
45755 "\"What's going on downstairs,\" he brooded grimly, \"while I am locked in"
45755 "up here? What are they talking about, I wonder? Is the mystery taking"
45755 "place, and am I missing it? Oh, this secret that I scent all around me"
45755 "when I am with grown-ups, this thing that they shut me out from at"
45755 "night, and that makes them lower their voices when I come upon them"
45755 "unawares, this great secret that has been near me for days, close at"

45755 "Edgar recalled the time when he had pilfered books from his father's"
45755 "library and had read them, and found they contained the mystery, though"
45755 "he could not understand it. There must be some sort of seal, he"
45755 "concluded, either in himself or in the others that had first to be"
45755 "removed before the mystery could be fathomed. He also recalled how he"
45755 "had begged the servant-girl to explain the obscure passages in the books"
45755 "and she had only laughed at him."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Dreadful,\" he thought, \"to be a child, full of curiosity, and yet not"
45755 "to be allowed even to ask for information, always to be ridiculed by the"
45755 "grown-ups, as if one were a stupid good-for-nothing. But never mind, I'm"
45755 "going to find it out, and very soon, I feel sure I will. Already part of"

45755 "He listened to find out if anyone were coming to the room. Outside, the"
45755 "trees were rustling in a strong breeze, which caught up the silvery"
45755 "mirror of the moonlight and dashed it in shivering bits through the"
45755 "network of the branches."
45755 ""
45755 "\"It can't be anything good that they intend to do, else they wouldn't"
45755 "have used such mean little lies to get me out of their way. Of course,"
45755 "they're laughing at me, the miserable creatures, because they're rid of"
45755 "me at last. But I'll be the one to laugh next. How stupid of me to allow"
45755 "myself to be locked in this room and give them a moment to themselves,"
45755 "instead of sticking to them like a burr and watching their every move. I"
45755 "know the grown-ups are always incautious, and _they_ will be giving"
45755 "themselves away, too. Grown-ups think we're still babies and always go"
45755 "to sleep at night. They forget we can pretend to be asleep and can go on"
45755 "listening, and we can make out we're stupid when we're really very"
45755 "bright.\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar smiled to himself sarcastically when at this point his thoughts"
45755 "reverted to the birth of a baby cousin. The family in his presence had"
45755 "pretended to be surprised, and he had known very well they were not"
45755 "surprised, because for weeks he had heard them, at night when they"
45755 "thought he was asleep, discussing the coming event. And he resolved to"
45755 "fool his mother and the baron in the same way."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Oh, if only I could peep through the key-hole and watch them while they"
45755 "fancy they're alone and safe. Perhaps it would be a good idea to ring,"
45755 "and the boy would come and open the door and ask what I want. Or I could"
45755 "make a terrible noise smashing things, and then they'd unlock the door"
45755 "and I'd slip out.\""
45755 ""
45755 "On second thought he decided against either plan, as incompatible with"
45755 "his pride. No one should see how contemptibly he had been treated, and"
45755 "he would wait till the next day."
45755 ""
45755 "From beneath his window came a woman's laugh. Edgar started. Perhaps it"
45755 "was his mother laughing. She had good cause to laugh and make fun of the"
45755 "helpless little boy who was locked up when he was a nuisance and thrown"
45755 "into a corner like a bundle of rags. He leaned, circumspectly out of the"
45755 "window and looked. No, it wasn't his mother, but one of a group of gay"
45755 "girls teasing a boy."
45755 ""
45755 "In looking out Edgar observed that his window was not very high above"
45755 "the ground, and instantly it occurred to him to jump down and go spy on"
45755 "his mother and the baron. He was all fire with the joy of his resolve,"
45755 "feeling that now he had the great secret in his grasp. There was no"
45755 "danger in it. No people were passing by--and with that he had jumped"
45755 "out. Nothing but the light crunch of the gravel under his feet to betray"
45755 "his action."

45755 "In these two days, stealing around and spying had become the delight of"
45755 "his life, and intense bliss, mingled with a faint tremor of alarm,"
45755 "filled him now as he tiptoed around the outside of the hotel, carefully"
45755 "avoiding the lights. He looked first into the dining-room. Their seats"
45755 "were empty. From window to window he went peeping, always outside the"
45755 "hotel for fear if he went inside he might run up against them in one of"
45755 "the corridors. Nowhere were they to be seen, and he was about to give up"
45755 "hope when he saw two shadows emerge from a side entrance--he shrank and"
45755 "drew back into the dark--and his mother and her inseparable escort came"
45755 "out."
45755 ""
45755 "In the nick of time, he thought. What were they saying? He couldn't"
45755 "hear, they were talking in such low voices and the wind was making such"
45755 "an uproar in the trees. His mother laughed. It was a laugh he had never"
45755 "before heard from her, a peculiarly sharp, nervous laugh, as though she"
45755 "had suddenly been tickled. It made a curious impression on the boy and"
45755 "rather startled him."
45755 ""
45755 "\"But if she laughs,\" he thought, \"it can't be anything dangerous,"
45755 "nothing very big and mighty that they are concealing from me.\" He was a"
45755 "trifle disillusioned. \"Yet, why were they leaving the hotel? Where were"
45755 "they going alone together in the night?\""
45755 ""
45755 "Every now and then great drifts of clouds obscured the moon, and the"
45755 "darkness was then so intense that one could scarcely see the white road"
45755 "at one's feet, but soon the moon would emerge again and robe the"
45755 "landscape in a sheet of silver. In one of the moments when the whole"
45755 "countryside was flooded in brilliance Edgar saw the two silhouettes"
45755 "going down the road, or rather one silhouette, so close did they cling"
45755 "together, as if in terror. But where were they going? The fir-trees"
45755 "groaned, the woods were all astir, uncannily, as though from a wild"
45755 "chase in their depths."
45755 ""
45755 "\"I will follow them,\" thought Edgar. \"They cannot hear me in all this"
45755 "noise.\""

45755 "Keeping to the edge of the woods, in the shadow, from which he could"
45755 "easily see them on the clear white road, he tracked them relentlessly,"

45755 "carrying away the sound of their talk. It was not until he heard what"
45755 "they said that he could be sure of learning the secret."
45755 ""

45755 "growing excitement, never dreaming that on the high edges of the road,"
45755 "in the leafy darkness, every movement of theirs was being watched, and a"
45755 "pair of eyes was clutching them in a wild grip of hate and curiosity."
45755 ""
45755 "Suddenly they stood still, and Edgar, too, instantly stopped and pressed"
45755 "close up against a tree, in terror that they might turn back and reach"
45755 "the hotel before him, so that his mother would discover his room was"
45755 "empty and learn that she had been followed. Then he would have to give"
45755 "up hope of ever wresting the secret from them. But the couple hesitated."
45755 "Evidently there was a difference of opinion between them. Fortunately at"
45755 "that moment the moon was shining undimmed by clouds, and he could see"
45755 "everything clearly. The baron pointed to a side-path leading down into"
45755 "the valley, where the moonlight descended, not in a broad flood of"
45755 "brilliance, but only in patches filtering here and there through the"
45755 "heavy foliage."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Why does he want to go down there?\" thought Edgar."
45755 ""
45755 "His mother, apparently, refused to take the path, and the baron was"
45755 "trying to persuade her. Edgar could tell from his gestures that he was"
45755 "talking emphatically. The child was alarmed. What did this man want of"
45755 "his mother? Why did he attempt--the villain!--to drag her into the dark?"
45755 "From his books, to him the world, came live memories of murder and"
45755 "seduction and sinister crime. There, he had it, the baron meant to"
45755 "murder her. That was why he had kept him, Edgar, at a distance, and"
45755 "enticed her to this lonely spot. Should he cry for help? Murder! He"
45755 "wanted to shriek, but his throat and lips were dry and no sound issued"
45755 "from his mouth. His nerves were tense as a bow-string, he could scarcely"
45755 "stand upright on his shaking knees, and he put out his hand for support,"
45755 "when, crack, crack! a twig snapped in his grasp."
45755 ""
45755 "At the sound of the breaking twig the two turned about in alarm and"
45755 "stared into the darkness. Edgar clung to the tree, his little body"
45755 "completely wrapped in obscurity, quiet as death. Yet they seemed to have"
45755 "been frightened."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Let's go home,\" he could now hear his mother say anxiously, and the"
45755 "baron, who, evidently, was also upset, assented. Pressed close against"
45755 "each other, they walked back very slowly. Their embarrassment was"
45755 "Edgar's good fortune. He got down on all fours and crept, tearing his"
45755 "hands and clothes on the brambles, through the undergrowth to the turn"
45755 "of the woods, from where he ran breathlessly back to the hotel and up"
45755 "the stairs to his room. Luckily the key was sticking on the outside, and"
45755 "in one second he was in his room lying on the bed, where he had to rest"
45755 "a few moments to give his pounding heart a chance to quiet down. After"

45755 "They must have been walking very slowly indeed. It took them an"
45755 "eternity. Circumspectly he peeped out of the shadowed frame. There, at"
45755 "length, they came at a snail's pace, the moonlight shining on their"
45755 "clothes. They looked like ghosts in the greenish shimmer, and the"
45755 "delicious horror came upon him again whether it really might have been a"
45755 "murder, and what a dreadful catastrophe he had averted by his presence."
45755 "He could clearly see their faces, which looked chalky in the white"
45755 "light. His mother had an expression of rapture that in her was strange"
45755 "to him, while the baron looked hard and dejected. Probably because he"
45755 "had failed in carrying out his purpose."

45755 "or telegraph his father--or why not that very moment? His mother was not"
45755 "in her room yet, but was still with that horrid person."
45755 ""
45755 "The outside of the door to Edgar's room was hung with a portiere, and he"
45755 "opened his door softly now, closed it behind him, and stuck himself"
45755 "between the door and the portiere, listening for his mother's steps in"
45755 "the corridor, determined not to let her stay by herself a single"
45755 "instant."
45755 ""
45755 "The corridor, at this midnight hour, was quiet and empty and lighted"
45755 "faintly by a single gas jet. The minutes stretched themselves into"
45755 "hours, it seemed, before he heard cautious footsteps coming up the"
45755 "stairs. He strained his ears to listen. The steps did not move forward"
45755 "with the quick, regular beat of someone making straight for his room,"
45755 "but sounded hesitating and dragging as though up a steep, difficult"
45755 "climb. Edgar also caught the sound of whispering, a pause, then"
45755 "whispering again. He was a-quiver with excitement. Was it both of them"
45755 "coming up together? Was the creature still sticking to her? The"
45755 "whispering was too low and far away for him to catch what they were"
45755 "saying. But the footsteps, though slowly and with pauses between, were"
45755 "drawing nearer. And now he could hear the baron's voice--oh, how he"
45755 "hated the sound of it!--saying something in a low, hoarse tone, which he"
45755 "could not get, and then his mother answering as though to ward something"
45755 "off:"
45755 ""
45755 "\"No, no, not tonight!\""
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar's excitement rose to fever heat. As they came nearer he would be"
45755 "bound to catch everything they said. Each inch closer that they drew was"
45755 "like a physical hurt in his breast, and the baron's voice, how ugly it"
45755 "seemed, that greedy, grasping disgusting voice."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Don't be cruel. You were so lovely this evening.\""
45755 ""
45755 "\"No, no, I mustn't. I can't. Let me go!\""
45755 ""
45755 "There was such alarm in his mother's voice that the child was terrified."
45755 "What did the baron want her to do? Why was she afraid?"
45755 ""
45755 "They were quite close up to him now, apparently right in front of the"
45755 "portiere. A foot or two away from them was he, trembling, invisible,"
45755 "with a bit of drapery for his only protection."
45755 ""
45755 "Edgar heard his mother give a faint groan as though her powers of"
45755 "resistance were weakening."
45755 ""
45755 "But what was that? Edgar could hear that they had passed his mother's"
45755 "door and had kept on walking down the corridor. Where was he dragging"
45755 "her off to? Why was she not replying any more? Had he stuffed his hand"
45755 "kerchief into her mouth and was he squeezing her throat?"
45755 ""
45755 "Wild with this thought, Edgar pushed the portiere aside and peeped out"
45755 "at the two figures in the dim corridor. The baron had his arm round the"
45755 "woman's waist and was forcing her along gently, evidently with little"
45755 "resistance from her. He stopped at his own door."
45755 ""
45755 "\"He wants to drag her in and commit the foul deed,\" though the child,"
45755 "and dashing the portiere aside he rushed down the hall upon them."
45755 ""
45755 "His mother screamed; something came leaping at her out of the dark, and"
45755 "she seemed to fall in a faint. The baron held her up with difficulty."
45755 "The next instant he felt a little fist dealing him a blow that smashed"
45755 "his lips against his teeth, and a little body clawing at him catlike. He"
45755 "released the terrified woman, who quickly made her escape, and, without"
45755 "knowing against whom, he struck out blindly."
45755 ""
45755 "The child knew he was the weaker of the two, yet he never yielded. At"
45755 "last, at last the great moment had come when he could unburden himself"
45755 "of all his betrayed love and accumulated hate. With set lips and a look"
45755 "of frenzy on his face he pounded away at the baron with his two small"
45755 "fists."
45755 ""
45755 "By this time the baron had recognized his assailant. He, too, was primed"
45755 "with hate of the little spy who had been dogging him and interfering"
45755 "with his sport, and he hit back, striking out blindly. Edgar groaned"
45755 "once or twice, but did not let go, and did not cry for help. They"
45755 "wrestled a fraction of a minute in the dark corridor grimly and sullenly"
45755 "without the exchange of a single word. But pretty soon the baron came to"
45755 "his senses and realizing how absurd was this duel with a half-grown boy"
45755 "he caught hold of Edgar to throw him off. But Edgar, feeling his"
45755 "muscles weakening and conscious that the next moment he would be beaten,"
45755 "snapped, in a fury, at the strong, firm hand gripping at the nape of his"
45755 "neck. The baron could not restrain a slight outcry, and let go of Edgar,"
45755 "who seized the opportunity to run to his room and draw the bolt."
45755 ""
45755 "The midnight struggle had lasted no more than a minute. No one in any of"
45755 "the rooms along the corridor had caught a sound of it. Everything was"
45755 "silent, wrapped in sleep."
45755 ""
45755 "The baron wiped his bleeding hand with his handkerchief and peered into"
45755 "the dark uneasily to make sure no one had been watching or listening."
45755 "All he saw was the one gas jet winking at him, he thought,"
45755 "sarcastically."

45755 "Edgar woke up the next morning dazed, wondering whether it had not been"
45755 "a horrid dream, and with the sickly feeling that hangs on after a"
45755 "nightmare, his head leaden and his body like a piece of wood. It was"
45755 "only after a minute or so that he realized with a sort of alarm that he"
45755 "was still in his day clothes. He jumped out of bed and went to look at"
45755 "himself in the mirror. The image of his own pale, distorted face, with"
45755 "his hair all rumpled and a red, elongated swelling on his forehead, made"
45755 "him recoil with a shudder. It brought back to him the actuality"
45755 "painfully. He recalled the details of the battle in the corridor, and"
45755 "his rushing back to his room and throwing himself on to the bed dressed."
45755 "He must have fallen asleep thus and dreamed everything over again, only"
45755 "worse and mingled with the warmish smell of fresh flowing blood."
45755 ""
45755 "Footsteps crunched on the gravel beneath his window, voices rose like"
45755 "invisible birds, and the sun shone deep into the room. \"It must be very"
45755 "late,\" he thought, glancing at his watch. But the hands pointed to"
45755 "midnight. In the excitement of the day before he had forgotten to wind"
45755 "it up. This uncertainty, this hanging suspended in time, disturbed him,"
45755 "and his sense of disgust was increased by his confusion of mind as to"
45755 "what had actually occurred. He dressed quickly and went downstairs, a"
45755 "vague sense of guilt in his heart."
45755 ""
45755 "In the breakfast-room his mother was sitting at their usual table,"
45755 "alone. Thank goodness, his enemy was not present. Edgar would not have"
45755 "to look upon that hateful face of his. And yet, as he went to the"
45755 "table, he was by no means sure of himself."
45755 ""
45755 "\"Good morning,\" he said."
45755 ""
45755 "His mother made no reply, nor even so much as glanced up, but kept her"
45755 "eyes fixed in a peculiarly rigid stare on the view from the window. She"
45755 "looked very pale, her eyes were red-rimmed, and there was that quivering"
45755 "of her nostrils which told so plainly how wrought up she was. Edgar bit"
45755 "his lips. Her silence bewildered him. He really did not know whether he"
45755 "had hurt the baron very much or whether his mother had any knowledge at"
45755 "all of their encounter. The uncertainty plagued him. But her face"
45755 "remained so rigid that he did not even attempt to look up for fear that"
45755 "her eyes, now hidden behind lowered lids, might suddenly raise their"
45755 "curtains and pop out at him. He sat very still, not daring to make the"
45755 "faintest sound, and raising the cup to his lips and putting it back on"
45755 "the saucer with the utmost caution, and casting furtive glances, from"
45755 "time to time, at his mother's fingers, which played with her spoon"
45755 "nervously and seemed, in the way they were bent, to show a secret anger."
45755 ""
45755 "For a full quarter of an hour he sat at the table in an oppressive"
45755 "expectancy of something that never came. Not a single word from her to"
45755 "relieve his tension. And now as his mother rose, still without any sign"
45755 "of having noticed his presence, he did not know what to do, whether to"
45755 "remain sitting at the table or to go with her. He decided upon the"
45755 "latter, and followed humbly, though conscious how ridiculous was his"
45755 "shadowing of her now. He reduced his steps so as to fall behind, and"
45755 "she, still studiously refraining from noticing him, went to her room."
45755 "When Edgar reached her door he found it locked."
45755 ""
45755 "What had happened? He was at his wits' end. His assurance of the day"
45755 "before had deserted him. Had he done wrong, after all, in attacking the"

45755 "Upon him and his mother lay the sultriness of a brewing tempest. They"

45755 "him, from room to room, the burden of this premonition, until his thin"
45755 "little neck bent under the invisible yoke, and by midday it was a very"
45755 "humble little fellow that took his seat at table."

45755 "Edgar, in renewed alarm, felt he was in the presence of a calculated,"
45755 "concentrated anger such as he had never before encountered. Until then"

45755 "ill feeling and soon melted into a mollifying smile. This time, however,"
45755 "he had, as he sensed, brought to the surface a wild emotion from the"
45755 "deeps of her being, and this powerful something that he had evoked"
45755 "terrified him. He scarcely dared to eat. His throat was parched and"
45755 "knotted into a lump."

45755 "followed her up to her room."

45755 "In the room she prolonged his agony by saying nothing for several"
45755 "minutes, during which he heard the striking of the clock, and outside a"
45755 "child laughing, and within his own breast his heart beating like a"
45755 "trip-hammer. Yet she, too, could not be feeling so very confident of"
45755 "herself either, because she kept her eyes averted and even turned her"
45755 "back while speaking to him."
45755 ""
45755 "\"I shall say nothing to you about the way you behaved yesterday. It was"
45755 "unpardonable, and it makes me feel ashamed to think of it. You have to"
45755 "suffer the consequences now of your own conduct. All I mean to say to"
45755 "you is that this is the last time you will be allowed to associate with"
45755 "your elders. I have just written to your father that either you must be"

45755 "\"You will ask the baron's pardon.\" Edgar gave a start, but his mother"
45755 "would not be interrupted. \"The baron left to-day, and you will write him"

45755 "\"You were dreaming.\""

45755 "That was too much. The child, by this time, knew that adults lie and"
45755 "resort to impudent little evasions, lies that slip through fine sieves,"
45755 "and cunning ambiguities. But this downright denial of an absolute fact,"
45755 "face to face, threw him into a frenzy."

45755 "people idling on the platform. Though it was evident they were harboring"
45755 "no suspicions, the child, as if his flight and his crime were branded"
45755 "on his forehead, felt that they were looking at nothing but him and were"
45755 "wondering why a mere boy such as he should be travelling alone. He drew"
45755 "a great sigh of relief when at last the first whistle sounded in the"
45755 "distance, and the rumbling came closer and closer, and the train that"
45755 "was to carry him out into the great world puffed and snorted into the"
45755 "station."

45755 "It was not until Edgar took his seat in the train that he noticed he had"
45755 "secured only a third-class passage. Having always travelled first class,"
45755 "he was again struck with a sense of difference. He saw there were"
45755 "distinctions that had escaped him. His fellow-passengers were unlike"
45755 "those of his first-class trips, a few Italian laborers, with tough hands"
45755 "and uncouth voices, carrying pickaxes and shovels. They sat directly"
45755 "opposite, dull and disconsolate-eyed, staring into space. They must"
45755 "have been working very hard on the road, for some of them slept in the"
45755 "rattling coach, open-mouthed, leaning against the hard, soiled wood."

45755 "\"They have been working to earn money,\" came into Edgar's mind, and he"
45755 "set to guessing how much they earned, but could not decide. And so"
45755 "another disturbing fact impressed itself upon him, that money was"
45755 "something one did not always have on hand, but had to be made somehow or"
45755 "other. And for the first time he became conscious of having taken the"
45755 "ease in which he had been lapped as a matter of course and that to the"
45755 "right and the left of him abysms yawned which his eyes had never beheld."
45755 "It came to him now with the shock of suddenness that there were trades"
45755 "and professions, that his life was hedged about by innumerable secrets,"
45755 "close at hand and tangible, though he had never noticed them."

45755 "Edgar was learning a good deal in that single hour of aloneness and saw"
45755 "many things as he looked out of his narrow compartment into the great"
45755 "wide world. And for all his dark dread, something began to unfold itself"
45755 "gently within him, not exactly happiness as yet, rather a marvelling at"
45755 "the diversity of life. He had fled, he felt, out of fear and cowardice,"
45755 "yet it was his first independent act, and he had experienced something"
45755 "of the reality that he had passed by, until then, without heeding it."
45755 "Perhaps he himself was now as much of a mystery to his mother and his"
45755 "father as the world had been to him. It was with different eyes that he"
45755 "looked out of the window. He was now viewing actualities, it seemed to"
45755 "him. A veil had been lifted from all things, and they were showing him"
45755 "the core of their purpose, the secret spring of their actions. Houses"
45755 "flew by as though torn away by the wind, and he pictured to himself the"
45755 "people living in them. Were they rich or poor, happy or unhappy? Were"
45755 "they filled with the same longing as he to know everything? And were"
45755 "there children in those houses like himself who had merely been playing"
45755 "with things? The flagmen who waved the train no longer seemed like"
45755 "scattered dolls, inanimate objects, toys stationed there by indifferent"
45755 "chance. Edgar now understood that the giving of the signal was their"
45755 "fate, their struggle with life."

45755 "The wheels turned faster and faster, along serpentine windings the train"
45755 "made its way downward from the uplands, the mountains took on gentler"
45755 "curves and receded into the distance. The level was reached, and Edgar"
45755 "gave one final glance backward. There were the mountains like blue"
45755 "shadows, remote and inaccessible. And to Edgar it was as though his"

45755 "himself about his fate. He passed through the gateway timidly. A few"
